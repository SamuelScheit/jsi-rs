# `jsi-rs`

This library makes it possible to write React Native JSI modules in Rust.

For an example, check out the `example` folder.

# Contributing

I wrote this code in winter 2022 as part of another project. A few months later,
I have decided to release it to the world. However, I'm not planning to maintain
it unless I encounter another project that requires it, so for now, the code is
given to you as-is. Feel free to contribute PRs that would improve the API or
stability of the library.

# Safety

Right now, this library is quite `unsafe`.
